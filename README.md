# Optimizing Dispute Management Processes in Banks

This repository contains code for optimizing dispute management processes within the banking sector. The project aims to process and analyze banking dispute data using machine learning techniques.

## Files Included

- **`ai.py`**: Contains the implementation for the AI model used to process banking dispute data.
- **`banking_dispute_dataset_zzu.csv`**: A CSV file containing the dataset used for analysis and model training.
- **`kmeans.py`**: The script that implements the K-means clustering algorithm for grouping similar disputes.
- **`Figures/`**: Folder that contains visualizations and figures related to the analysis.
- **`.gitignore`**: Specifies files and directories that should be ignored by Git.
- **`LICENSE`**: MIT license file for the project.
- **`README.md`**: This readme file.

## Dataset

The **`banking_dispute_dataset_zzu.csv`** file contains data related to various banking disputes, which will be used to train machine learning models and analyze dispute patterns. The dataset includes relevant information like the type of dispute, customer details, and the time it takes to resolve issues.
